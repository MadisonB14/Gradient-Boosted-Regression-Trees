# Gradient-Boosted-Regression-Trees

Gradient boosted regression trees were used to explore the results of simulating ASF spread in wild pigs across a landscape. Initial parameters varied (predictors) include:
* host density
* infectious period of living individuals
* infectious period of carcasses on landscape
* incubation period
* proportion that recover
* days to recovery

Outbreak traits of interest:
* landscape area affected at 1 year
* peak number of cases
* outbreak probability
* rate of spread
* global seroprevalence at 1 year

NOTE: If using these scripts, cross validate first and then run the regression code with the parameters resulting in the highest $R^2$ value.
